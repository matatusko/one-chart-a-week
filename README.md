# One Chart a Week

Hello there!


This repository is a little challange that I have set for myself to improve my &#128202; data analysis and visualization skills 
and finally master [d3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3). I've learning that library on and off for a while, but never truly even scratched
its full potential. Hopefully, this will change now - it's something that I've been wanting to do for a while and seeing all those 
beautiful and creative charts on the web made by extremely talented people just keep inspiring me &#128293;

## The Challenge 

Because no challenge comes without the rules!

1. **One chart a week for 30 weeks**
<br>While not encouraged, it is alright to spend 2 or 3 weeks on a single assignment if more time is needed. 
Despite any additional time needed, one chart is always counted as one week, so 30 charts in total.

2. **No chart alike another**
<br>Not a single chart or graph can resemble another. [datavizproject.com](https://datavizproject.com/) has some great examples 
to get inspiration from.

3. **Start easy, finish hard**
<br>The idea is to master d3.js library, one step at a time. The challenge should begin with a simple bar chart or scatter plot,
continue through static sankey diagram or radial histogram and finish on complex, interactive and animated data visualizations.

4. **Truthful and practical**
<br>Random data is not allowed. It's part of the challenge to find interesting, reliable data and visualize it in most fitting way.

5. **Reinvent the wheel**
<br>It's more than alright to get inspired and use bits of codes from another projects, but full copy-paste is strictly prohibited.
The key is to dig deep into the d3.js library and its documentation by reinventing the wheel and producing all charts from scratch.
